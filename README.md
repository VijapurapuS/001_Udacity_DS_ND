# 001_Udacity_DS_Nano Degree
Repository for Udacity Data Science Nano Degree assignment
1. Installations
The below installations are required for this notebook on IPL Data Analysis:
Pandas, NumPy, MatPlotLib, seaborn, time, sklearn (SciKit) for the learning models and WordCloud for visualizations

2. Project Motivation
Cricket is the most popular sport in India and the players are held on a very high pedestal with GOD like status.
It is but natural (being a cricket lover) that when you lay your hands on a cricket dataset, you try to slice and dice and try to gain insights and try to predict the outcome based on the Data Science statistical models. Here is my attempt as a beginner from scratch and my motivation for this project to try and predict the winner based on the datasets

3. File Descriptions
Ud_5_DS_Blog _29E.ipynb --> Jupyter Notebook containing the code
matches.csv --> contains information on matches played, teams, toss winners, toss decisions and winning team amongst other information
delieries.csv --> dataset contains ball by ball information for all the IPL matches with runs and extras and dismissal types
README.md --> Instructions for using this notebook and installations required
Predict_Winner.csv --> Target dataset where the predictions will be written out to.
DataDictionary.csv --> contains mapping for team names, decisions etc.

4. How to Interact with your project
Please start by reading the README.md file.
Ud_5_DS_Blog _29E.ipynb is the guts of the data analysis using Jupyter Notebook containing the code

Steps:
-----
1. Update the Predict_Winner.csv file with 'team1',	'team2',	'city',	'toss_decision',	'toss_winner' with values using the DataDictonary.csv
2. Access the Ud_5_DS_Blog _29E.ipynb
3. Ensure all the necessary installations are available for the notebook to run
4. Select-->Run All option (Few different models are available, uncomment the code accordingly based on your preference)
5. 'Winner' column in Predict_Winner.csv will be populated with the predictions
